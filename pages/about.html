		<p>Hi! I'm a ceramicist located in Richmond, Virginia, working out of the Hand / Thrown studio in Northside. What started as a "pandemic hobby" in 2021 has become so much more, and this website hopefully shows just that. Using stoneware, I focus primarily on functional pieces (e.g. mugs, bowls, planters) but also enjoy creating more decorative wares (e.g. vases). Regardless of the form, I love using surface design and geometric details in much of my work.</p>
		<p>Note: currently, this website is just a portfolio of the pieces I'm most proud of, but in the future I am working on an ecommerce functionality. Stay tuned!</p>
