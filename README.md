## Documentation Notes

### Portfolio pic image names

Format depends on whether many pieces of that type are being made, or if there are currently a finite and easily identifiable number of them that exist.

*Finite:*

`description&type-# made-pic #.png`

E.g. `black-geometric-bowl-01-02.png` &rArr; second picture documenting the first black geometric bowl currently on record

*Infinite:*

Just remove the "# made" part and pluralize the ware type.

E.g. `pumpkin-mugs-03.png`
